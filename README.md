macOS Project demonstrating how to read user input from the Command Line

This is an Xcode project using the Comnand Line Tool template. I've added two classes: Input and Output. 
Each class has a singleton method that allows us to read user input from the command line, 
and write to the command line respectively (without timestamps, like NSLog would do).

I'm using NSFileHandle for both classes.

This article explains what's happening in more detail:
